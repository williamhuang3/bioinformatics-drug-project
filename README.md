<h1>Bioinformatics AI Drug Descriptors Project</h1>
<p>This program uses the ChemBL Database to find a chemical/biological target, (in this example, Histone Deacetylase 1) and then uses the Lipinski Rule of 5 to evaluate the compounds that interact with the target to locate viable drug/treatment candidates. </p>
